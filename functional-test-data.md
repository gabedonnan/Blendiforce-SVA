Material M = STEEL

Material Radius R = 10 m

Material Mass = 1 kg

Notes:

Very little displacement due to high rigidity of the material

## Displacement of model under uniform load: 2

Material M = STEEL

Material Radius R = varied

Material Mass m = 100kg

Spring Constant K = 30 N/m

Large rotational displacement due to the imbalanced system and low spring constant on base

## Displacement of model under uniform load with springs and base node support + y directional rotation and displacement lock: 5
